# Concepts of Computer Networking

(1) Computer Networking
-

- Represents a graph with physical devices and connections between them
- The physical devices are the **nodes**
- The connections are the **edges**
 
Networking Hardware

### Adapters

- PCI cards
- USB/CardBus adapter

### Modem

- A device, which allows the computer to transfer data via **dial-up** or **DSL**

Protocols
-

- A rule about how should the data be transfer via Internet

Topologies
-

- It is about how the physical devices should be organized
  - **Physical** - defines the layout of the physical devices
  - **Signal** - defines how the signals travel(electrical or wirelessly)
  - **Logical** - defines how data flows(Ethernet, switch LAN/WAN and etc.)

- **Logical Topology** is defined by the *networking architecture*

Standarts
-

- ISO/IEEE 802

Metropolitan Area Networks(MAN)
-

- Backbone and client interface

Commutation
-

- The responsibility to maintain a connection
- **Commutation of packets** - transfering segments of the data with numbering each transfer

(2) OSI Model And TCP
-

Decomposing
-

- Breaking down a complex task into several simpler tasks â€“ modules

Multilayer network architecture
-

- Each layer offers an interface for the next layer
- If we change the implementation of one layer, this shouldn't break the oder ones - **transparency** and **flexibility**
- **Service** - defines the functionalities of the layer
- **Interface** - defines the way which the layer can be accessed
- **Protocol** - defines the realization of the service

Layers

| Name | Description | Devices | Protocols | Realization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Physical** | Decoding and encoding the signals | **Networking cards**, **Modems** | **Ethernet**, **Wi-Fi** | Hardware |
| **Data Link** | Controlling the **P2P** model. The data is exchanged with portions(**PDU**) | **Switch** | **MAC** | Hardware |
| **Network** | Responsible for the functioning of the communication subnet. Assigns IP adresses and manages packages | **Routers**, **Firewalls** | **IP** | Hardware/Program |
| **Transport** | Ensures the transportation of the data from sender to reciever (using ports, *end-to-end*), by accepting segments(**PDU**) from or passing them to the **Network Layer** | **Load Balancers**, **Firewalls** | **TCP**, **UDP** | Program |
| **Session** | Responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions between applications | **Gateways** | **RPC** | Program |
| **Presentation** | Formats, (d)encrypts/ and compresses data | **VPN**, **Proxy** | **SSL/TSL** | Program |
| **Application** | Handles user interactions and application services | **Web servers** | **HTTP**, **FTP**, **DNS** | Program |

TCP/IP
-

- Communication protocol that defines how data is transmitted, received over networks

| Protocol | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | -- |
| **IP** | Packets are sent without prior setup of a session between sender and receiver and can take different paths to reach the destination | **Connectionless** |
| **UDP** | Runs on top of IP. Used for real-time applications like VoIP, video streaming, and online gaming | **Connectionless** |
| **TCP** | Establishes a connection before sending data (via handshake). It ensures reliable delivery, correct order, and error correction | **Connection-based** |

Random Linear Network Coding
-

- Encodes each package in a linear equation, meaning decoding needs N packages to decode whole data

(3) Channel level
-
