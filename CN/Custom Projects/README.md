# Concepts of Computer Networking

(1) Computer Networking
-

- Represents a graph with physical devices and connections between them
- The physical devices are the **nodes**
- The connections are the **edges**
 
Networking Hardware

### Adapters

- PCI cards
- USB/CardBus adapter

### Modem

- A device, which allows the computer to transfer data via **dial-up** or **DSL**

Protocols
-

- A rule about how should the data be transfer via Internet

Topologies
-

- It is about how the physical devices should be organized
  - **Physical** - defines the layout of the physical devices
  - **Signal** - defines how the signals travel(electrical or wirelessly)
  - **Logical** - defines how data flows(Ethernet, switch LAN/WAN and etc.)

- **Logical Topology** is defined by the *networking architecture*

Standarts
-

- ISO/IEEE 802

Metropolitan Area Networks(MAN)
-

- backbone and client interface

Commutation
-

- The responsibility to maintain a connection
- **Commutation of packets** - transfering segments of the data with numbering each transfer

(2) OSI Model
-

Decomposing
-

- Breaking down a complex task into several simpler tasks – modules

Multilayer network architecture
-

- Each layer offers an interface for the next layer
- If we change the implementation of one layer, this shouldn't break the oder ones - **transparency** and **flexibility**
- **Service** - defines the functionalities of the layer
- **Interface** - defines the way which the layer can be accessed
- **Protocol** - defines the realization of the service

| --- | --- | -- |
| **Physical** | Decoding and encoding bits | **Networking cards**, **Switch** |
| **Data Link** | Controlling the **P2P** model. The data is shared with portions(**PDU**)| **MAC**|
| **Network** | | |
| **Transport** |  | |
