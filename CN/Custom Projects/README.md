# Concepts of Computer Networking

Computer Networking
-

- Represents a graph with physical devices and connections between them
- The physical devices are the **nodes**
- The connections are the **edges**
 
Networking Hardware

### Adapters

- PCI cards
- USB/CardBus adapter

### Modem

- A device, which allows the computer to transfer data via **dial-up** or **DSL**

Protocols
-

- A rule about how should the data be transfer via Internet

Topologies
-

- It is about how the physical devices should be organized
  - **Physical** - defines the layout of the physical devices
  - **Signal** - defines how the signals travel(electrical or wirelessly)
  - **Logical** - defines how data flows(Ethernet, switch LAN/WAN and etc.)

- **Logical Topology** is defined by the *networking architecture*

Standarts
-

- ISO/IEEE 802

Metropolitan Area Networks(MAN)
-

- backbone and client interface

Commutation
-

- The responsibility to maintain a connection
- **Commutation of packets** - transfering segments of the data with numbering each transfer
