# Hardware Elements

Most Common Elements
-

- Relays
  - Have coil, which induces current, and thus mechanically makes changes(connects) to the electronical chain
- MOSFET Transistors(
  - The most modern ones
  - They have Base/Gate(Condition), Emiter/Source(In) and Collector/Drain(Out)
  - N-channel, P-channel

Basic Logical Elements
-  

- NOT
- NAND, AND
- NOR, OR
- XOR, NXOR

Some Circuits

- Link to schemes(pages 15 - 35) - [here](https://learn.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/pluginfile.php/520036/mod_resource/content/2/L02-HardwareElements.pdf)
- Memory(SR Latch), Clocked SR/D Latch, D Flip Flop
  - Main Purpose -> Made to save 1 bit info
